# tictactoe
A tictactoe game that simulates communicating over a server to an AI opponent. The AI is incredibly basic: it just fills the first available spot going left to right, up to down. The intent of this project was not to make a complex AI opponent, but to further understanding of what data is necessary to send for the game to work.
